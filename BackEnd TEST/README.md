BackEnd TEST

/!\ Work in progress /!\

Requirements:
Node 10.16.3
MySQL 5.7.27

This project contains everything related to my attempts with backend understanding.
Ultimately, it should contain a simple express server with an simple react front, a MySQL database at least.
Up to date, nothing relevant can be run, I'm still figuring out how things work.
